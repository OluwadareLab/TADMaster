Multiresolution domain calling software for chromosome conformation capture interaction matrices.

Current release: Armatus 2.2
------------

The latest version of Armatus now supports parsing high resolution matrices generated by Rao et al. at a 5kbp resolution.  An example of how to run it on their data in a shell script:

    ARMATUS=armatus/build/src/armatus
    for i in `seq 1 22`
    do
        INPUT=GM12878_combined/5kb_resolution_intrachromosomal/chr$i/MAPQGE30/chr${i}_5kb
        time ./$ARMATUS -m -r 5000 -R -c $i -i $INPUT -g 1.0 -s 0.05 -o raodomains/chr$i
    done

This version will run Armatus in serial on all 22 chromosomes on a cell type for the Rao et al. data set.  The -m option outputs the domains at different resolutions, the -r option specifies the resolution, the -R option uses the parser for the Rao et al. data.  It will generate domains between gamma=0.0 to 1.0 at steps of 0.05.

Also note that the Dixon et al. format for the matrices on their web site has changed since the original release of Armatus.  Specifically, its first three columns were chromosome number, fragment start, and fragment end.  We have now changed our parser to accept their updated format: i.e. there are not three columns preceeding the actual matrix data and you must feed in the resolution as a parameter to Armatus.

The current version uses dense matrices instead of sparse matrices since populating sparse matrices at high resolutions increases the run time substantially. As an example, chromosome 10 of Rao et al. currently consumes approximately 8GB of memory and each resolution completes in approximately 2-3 minutes on a single thread using an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v2 @ 3.00GHz.

Installation
------------

Check the <a href="https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/armatus/releases">Releases</a> section of github for current executable binaries. If a binary
isn't available for your system, you can build from source as described below.

Input format
------------

Format 1: Gzipped matrices: if you have an n-by-n matrix, you can encode it as a text file that contains n tab-separated numbers on each line. For example:

	100	100	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
	100	100	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
	100	100	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
 	0	0	0	100	100	100	0	0	0	0
 	0	0	0	100	100	100	0	0	0	0
 	0	0	0	100	100	100	0	0	0	0
 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	100	100	100
 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	100	100	100
 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	100	100	100

Then you gzip this text file. This gzipped file can then be provided to Armatus via the `-i` flag.

Format 2: The format of Rao et al. domains (see first section above). You must use the `-R` option. 

Output Format
-------------

Armatus will produce files with 3 columns that look like this:

    N/A     0       49
    N/A     50      99
    N/A     100     149

The first column is the chromosome number/name (given with `-c`) or "N/A" if none is given. The next two columns give the start and ending indices of fragments in a domain. The indices are INCLUSIVE. Each line represents a domain, so the first line above indicates a domain that spans from someplace in fragment 0 to someplace in fragment 49.

If the `-r` resolution parameter is given, then the above numbers will be scaled by this resolution in the following way:

    output_start = start_fragment * resolution
    output_end = (end_fragment+1)*resolution - 1

That is: the range will be the nucleotide range that spans the fragments in the domain.

Usage
-----

You can get a list of Armatus' command line arguments by passing the `--help` parameter. The current arguments are:

    -R [ --parseRaoFormat ]               Parse the Rao data format instead of 
                                          Dixon et al. (Provide, for example, 
                                          GM12878_combined/5kb_resolution_intrach
                                          romosomal/chr1/MAPQGE30/chr1_5kb,  and 
                                          KR normalization is used.
    -N [ --noNormalization ]              No normalization (Rao et al. format)
    -g [ --gammaMax ] arg                 gamma-max (highest resolution to 
                                          generate domains)
    -j [ --justGammaMax ]                 Just obtain domains at the maximum 
                                          Gamma

    -m [ --outputMultiscale ]             Output multiscale domains to files as 
                                          well
    -r [ --resolution ] arg (=1)          Resolution of data
    -c [ --chromosome ] arg (=N/A)        Chromosome
    -n [ --minMeanSamples ] arg (=100)    Minimum required number of samples to 
                                          compute a mean
    -o [ --output ] arg                   output filename prefix
    -s [ --stepSize ] arg (=0.050000000000000003)
                                          Step size to increment resolution 
                                          parameter






WARNING
-------

We have noticed that occassionally, the *order* of the arguments passed can result in a memory bug that is yet unexplained since we are using the Boost argument parser.  We are working to resolve this issue.  If you experience this issue, place the "-m" argument before the "-k" argument.

Example Run
-----------

The main inputs into Armatus are the matrix file (in the format of Dixon et al.: http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.html) and the gammaMax parameter which determines the highest resolution at which domains are to be generated.  *Note*: we recently noticed that the format of the matrices of Dixon et al. in the link above has changed.
An example run on chromosome 1 of a human fibroblast:

    time armatus -i IMR90/40kb/combined/chr1.nij.comb.40kb.matrix.gz -g .5 -o test -m

The first `-i` parameter is a gzipped HiC matrix for chromosome 1 as obtained from Dixon et al. the second `-g` parameter is the maximum gamma at which to sample at.  Output files are all written with a prefix `test`.

Other options allow for sampling multiple near-optimal solutions and considering finer levels of step sizes. These are 'idealized' parameters in the sense that ideally we would sample as many resolutions as possible and consider all solutions that are reasonably close to the optimal solution.

We have also added a simple example in the "examples/" directory for your convenience.


Building from Source
------------------------

Dependencies:

* C++11
* Boost (Graph, Test, ublas, program options, system)

Note: Although this should be conceptually easy, properly installing these dependencies can be tricky since on a system like OS X you can choose to use different compilers and standard libraries.  Please make sure that boost is installed with the same standard libary and compiler that you are using to compile Armatus. For this reason, binaries of Armatus will also be released.

Here is an example of how to compile boost with Clang++ and use Clang++ to compile Armatus on OS X:

Boost-specific details:

    ./bootstrap --prefix=$HOME/boost
    ./b2 clean
    ./b2 install toolset=clang cxxflags="-stdlib=libc++" linkflags="-stdlib=libc++"

Using CMake to compile Armatus:

    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DBOOST_ROOT=$HOME/boost -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=true ..
    make
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/boost/lib

Make sure you substitute `$HOME/boost` with the installation path you desire.

Here is one-liner to compile Armatus with G++ given you have the proper dependencies:

     g++ -std=c++11 -w -lboost_system -lboost_iostreams -lboost_program_options -L /opt/local/lib/ -I include/ -I /opt/local/include/ -O3 -o binaries/armatus-linux-x64 src/*.cpp 

Note that this assumes you have Boost installed in "/opt/local".
